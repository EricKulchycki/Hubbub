All mobile code for sprint 1 is in modile_s1.

Instructions to Run:

1. Enter server folder ( 'cd server' )
2. Install server dependencies ( 'npm install' )
    - If an error to the effect of "react-scripts is not recognized..." appears, install react-scripts ('npm install react-scripts --save' )
    - If another error occurs, try again in a few minutes. Sometimes the servers are too busy to respond
3. Start server ( 'node app.js' )
4. Enter client folder ( 'cd ../client' )
5. Install dependencies ( 'npm install' )
    - If an error to the effect of "react-scripts is not recognized..." appears, install react-scripts ('npm install react-scripts --save' )
    - If another error occurs, try again in a few minutes. Sometimes the servers are too busy to respond
6. Start client ( 'npm start' )

Client should now be running at localhost:3000. A browser window should open on it's own in a few moments.
If this does not happen, open a web browser of your choice and enter "localhost:3000" in the address bar.
